= activeworlds-ffi

== Description

A Ruby/FFI wrapper for the Active Worlds, Inc. SDK providing for the rapid
creation and deployment of "bots".

== Requirements

You must have the Active Worlds SDK (currently only the linux version, build
77), and the ffi gem version 0.3.5 installed. The SDK must be on your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is a 32-bit only library because of the AW SDK, and so
for linking purposes you must have 32-bit versions of all libraries used, in
particular libstdc++.so.6 (if you have a different c++ lib, change the name in
lib/activeworlds_ffi.rb).

Also, you may need to modify your SELinux settings in order for the aw_sdk 
library to be loaded.
