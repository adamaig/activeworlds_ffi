This directory holds some of the tools used to create this gem. In particular
use the ffi-swig-generator gem to run 

rake ffi:generate

in order to generate the C wrapper. This is much easier/maintainable than hand 
editing things.

This requires unpacking the aw_sdk build 84 package into this directory (ie,
Aw.h must be in this same directory as the .i and Rakefile)
